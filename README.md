## For Soumen da whose leagal career is dominated by the internet,

It doesn't matter if it is a surprise or not, guys are not invited to a bachelorette party! Of course, you are misleading us with the wrong question to get closer to your agenda. And it is not a secret anymore, you generously made sure of that. Besides, with all the people in Vermont, your choice of company to bring to the party was very questionable.


## For Jayita di who is the one getting married,

Yes, the party is still in honor of your bachelor's life ending. As you can see you are so popular in the town that everybody wants to be there for the celebration. Obviously, we are looking forward to having a blast! And I am sure that your party is still a secret just not from you! Besides, would you consider a "guy" maid of honor?



## For Bristy apu the only person who really has the power to decide if Soumen da can join,

I don't know why he is wasting his time convincing everyone in the group when convincing you should be the main goal. Also, you enjoying the party is the main objective so that you don't have to worry about what Mum Mum is doing. However, with all the executive power at hand, you have been so cool and calm which is very admirable.
