# Jayita Di's Bachelorette Party Should be a Secret!

## For Soumen da who would believe anything on the internet,

It doesn't matter if it is a secret or not, guys are not so interested in a bachelorette party! I'm sure more Google searches will be there to convince you! And it is not a secret anymore, you generously made sure of that. Although it is entertaining messing with you when I can write anything on a webpage and this is what you call "Reference", I have an unlimited supply of that for you. Besides, with all the people in Vermont, your choice of company to bring to the party was very questionable.


## For Jayita Di who is the one getting married,

Yes, the party is still in honor of your bachelor's life ending. As you can see you are so popular in the town that everybody wants to be there for the celebration. Obviously, we are looking forward to having a blast! And I am sure that your party is still a secret just not from you! Besides, would you consider a "guy" maid of honor?



## For Bristy Apu the only person who really has the power to decide if Soumen Da can join,

I don't know why he is wasting his time convincing everyone in the group when convincing you should be the main goal. Also, you enjoying the party is the main objective so that you don't have to worry about what Mum Mum is doing. However, with all the executive power at hand, you have been so cool and calm which is very admirable.
